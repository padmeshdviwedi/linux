# 🌌 Sarvwigyan Linux Kernel Fork  
*Towards a Conscious Technological Future*

## 🔭 Purpose

This repository is a **fork of the official Linux kernel** — not for casual edits, but for a greater vision. I am exploring, modifying, and adapting the Linux kernel as the **foundation for creating advanced technological systems** under the umbrella of **Sarvwigyan** (सर्वविज्ञान) — a knowledge-driven initiative for the benefit of all humanity.

> **“Technology should not just serve machines or markets — it should serve mankind.”**

## 🧠 Vision

Sarvwigyan envisions a unified platform that integrates **science**, **philosophy**, **artificial intelligence**, **quantum systems**, and **deep human values**. This fork of the Linux kernel serves as the **core infrastructure** to build:

- 🧬 **Open-source AI systems** that align with ethics and truth  
- 🛰️ **Autonomous scientific tools** for research, space, biotech, and beyond  
- 🕸️ **Decentralized knowledge networks** (like Sarvpedia, SarvStore, SarvOS)  
- 🧭 **OS-level experimental environments** for AGI and quantum computation  
- 🤖 **A new generation of operating systems** infused with Indian philosophical foundations and modern computational logic

## ⚙️ What Will Be Done Here

- Kernel-level optimization for **low-latency AI interaction**
- Modularity for **learning systems** and **custom devices**
- Experiments in **quantum-inspired kernel logic**
- Development of **SarvOS** — an OS built for thinkers, researchers, and creators

## 📜 Philosophy

This kernel fork is more than software — it is **sankalp (संकल्प)** — a spiritual commitment to build tools that amplify the **highest human potential**, combining deep **Indian wisdom** with **cutting-edge science**.

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

Thanks to **Linus Torvalds** and the thousands of contributors to the Linux kernel. This fork stands on the shoulders of giants, to reach towards the eternal.
